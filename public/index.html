    <h1>Anarch</h1>

    <span class="subtitle">the suckless, anticapitalist, public domain game, for everyone</span>

    <img src="assets/logo_big.png">

    <span class="wow">THIS IS SPECIAL</span>

    <p class="description">
      This isn't a 90s style retro shooter, this <b>is</b> a 90s shooter.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      This game runs everywhere and adheres to extreme <a href="https://suckless.org">simplicity</a>.
      It is so efficient, portable and hackable that not even Doom can
      match it. It has completely <b>no dependencies</b> and doesn't even
      use floating point in case your computer doesn't have it. It can
      fit into TODO (with assets included!) and runs with XXX RAM. No build
      system, library, internet connection or package manager is required for
      compilation.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      This game is not just a mere entertainment, it is an art that
      categorically rejects capitalist technology.
    </p>

    <span class="wow">IT'IS MORE THAN A GAME</span>

    <p class="description">
      This is not a mere game meant for killing time or low goals such as making
      profit, this is an art, a tool, a blueprint, a manifesto. Anarch can be
      used for entertainment, but also for education, research, media creation,
      as a benchmark, as a test, as an environment, as an engine, as a basis for
      something greater. Only your imagination is the limit. Nothing is hidden,
      everything is allowed and encouraged, no burdens are imposed.
    </p>

    <span class="wow">NO ONE OWNS THIS</span>

    <p class="description">
      Not even I, the creator, own any part of this game.
      I&nbsp;have purposefully created everything myself from scratch,
      including the engine, graphics, sounds, music, even the font and palette,
      so that I could eventually give up all my rights and
      dedicate this game fully and completely to the public domain,
      to you, my dear fellow human being. No one shoud be allowed to own
      information and art.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      I've done my best to ensure this is 100% free as in freedom sotware and
      culture, well understandable and documented. This isn't made for any
      profit. This is made out of <b>love</b>, for the greater good.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Why?</dt>
      <dd>
        Because I find it ridiculously depressing that in a world where we have
        millions of computer games there isn't a single serious one made
        purely for the benefit of everyone on the planet, without self-interest
        (liceses, ads, DRM, ...)  being embedded somewhere underneath. It may be
        one of the saddest things about this so called "advanced" society.
      </dd>

      <dt>So I can really do anything with this?</dt>
      <dd>
        Legally yes, you are only limited by your morals. I believe written
        law is extremely bad and that no one should be allowed to own
        any information, so I purposfully abandon my legal ability to "defend" my
        work and try to make you use your moral sense instead, which you may have
        stopped using due to being told by the rules what is or isn't good. I
        ask you, without it being a legal condition, that start sharing your own
        work freely as I do, to spread this mentality. But only if you agree with
        me.
      </dd>

      <dt>Who are you?</dt>
      <dd>
        I am an anarcho-pacifist programmer. At day I am forced to be a
        cleaning slave at a factory, at night I contribute to society. You can
        read more about me at my <a href="https://www.tastyfish.cz">website</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is this a joke?</dt>
      <dd>No.</dd>

      <dt>Can I support you?</dt>
      <dd>
        Yes, this isn't made for any profit, but if you decide you want to gift
        some food to a fellow human being, you can find my support info at my
        <a href="https://www.tastyfish.cz">website</a>.
