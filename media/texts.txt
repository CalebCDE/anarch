Anarch: a Very Special Game

Anarch: super small public domain no-dependency from-scratch suckless Doom clone

I've made this super small public domain no-dependency from-scratch suckless
Doom clone.

Anarch: extremely small, completely public domain, no-dependency, no-file,
portable suckless anarcho-pacifist from-scratch 90s-style Doom clone that runs
everywhere, made for the benefit of all living beings.

Anarch is a completely public domain, free software 90s-style anarcho-pacifist
Doom clone game which can fit into <MINSIZE> (including all assets), has
extremely low hardware demands, running on platforms with <MINRAM> of RAM on
<MINFREQ> CPU (which doesn't even has to have a floating point unit), has no
dependencies (not even standard C library), requires no filesystem (all assets
are embedded in source code), is extremely portable, made in pure C99 subset
of C++ completely from scratch (including the engine, all assets, the font,
palette etc.) with only free software and released completely into the public
domain (CC0), allowing absolutely any use. It was not made for profit or just
entertainment, it is an engineering art and a philosofical manifesto. For more
info see the website at <WEBSITE> or the repository at <REPOURL>.

The game has been ported to:

- GNU/Linux, SDL
- GNU/Linux, terminal
- web browser, emscripten
- Pokitto (220x116, 48 MHz ARM, 36 KB RAM, 256 KB flash)
- Gamebino Meta (80x64, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM, 256 KB flash)
- Win$hit 7, SDL

As a game, Anarch offers:

- oldschool "pseudo 3D" raycasting rendering in 256 colors
- 10 levels, both interior and exterior, 16 wall textures
- varying floor and ceiling heights, ability to jump
- 6 weapons using 3 types of ammo
- 7 types of enemies
- optional primitive save/load system
- optional mouse support
- hidden secrets

======== short manual ========

Anarch is a unique suckless FPS game. Collect weapons and items and destroy
robot enemies in your way in order to get to the level finish. Some door are
locked and require access cards. Good luck!

========== pokitto ===========

I am releasing the version 1.0 of my uber game Anarch!

It's a Doom-like first person shooter with 10 levels. It is completely public
domain (CC0), so you can do whatever you wish with it: mod it, hack it, break
it, share it, even sell it. You can just grab it and start playing, however the
project has also become a manifesto of my philosophies, going beyond simple
entertainment purpose, so if you wish to check it out further, visit

<WEBSITE>

and

<REPOURL>

The game is not exclusive to Pokitto, I've made it to be independent of any
platform and you can also play it on your computer, in a browser
(<PLAYINBROWSER>), or on other consoles. However, it all started here, with the
Pokitto community, when a few years back Pokitto showed me the joy of
programming simple HW, when I began to play around with raycasting, which later
resutlted in raycastlib and eventually this game. Fot this I thank all of you.

Controls are:

- arrows: movement
- A: shoot, confirm
- B: hold for strafing, cancel
- C + A, C + B: switch weapons
- C + up: jump
- C + down: menu

Enjoy!

========== gb meta ===========

This is a GB Meta port of my suckless, platform-independent Doom-like game
Anarch, made with the help of a raycasting library (raycastlib) I've made and
also showcased here on GB Meta some time ago.

The game is completely public domain free software, you can do absolutely
anything with it. It is a small manifesto to some ideas I hold: if you wish to
know more, visit the game's website at <WEBSITE> or the repo at <REPOURL>. You
can also play the game in browser at <PLAYINBROWSER>.  

I didn't spend too much time on the GB Meta port and I think it could be done
better, maybe rendered in higher resolution, with music and game's sounds. If
anyone skilled with Meta wants to pursue this task, just go ahead :)

Controls are:

- arrows: movement 
- A: shoot, confirm
- B: hold for strafing, cancel
- menu + A, menu + B: switch weapons
- menu + up: jump
- menu + down: go to menu

======== opengameart =========

These are the assets from my public domain Doom-like game Anarch (<WEBSITE>).
I have made them all completely myself, from scratch, including taking my own
photos, recording my own sounds etc. I release them all under CC0 1.O, public
domain, for any use whatsoever.

# Finally releasing my suckless game Anarch!

I have spent a few years on this game. It is very special, one of its kind, a
manifesto to the ideas and philosophies I hold.

The game is extremely small, completely public domain (CC0) free software, has
no-dependencies, is extremely portable, suckless, made completely from-scratch
in the 90s-style of the original Doom. I made it for the benefit of all living
beings and am now sharing it with you. Enjoy and spread it around!

======= video trailer =======

This is a trailer for my public domain Doom-like game Anarch. The game is very
special, extremely small, suckless, with tiny hardware demands, running
basically on any platforms. It has many nice properties and is one of its kind.
It is completely free, both as in gratis and freedom. To get it, visit
<WEBSITE>.

palette.

======= libregamewiki ========

Anarch is a completely public domain, free software, 90s-style anarcho-pacifist
Doom-like libre game. It was created by drummyfish, made with a special
philosophy in mind.

The game is made for entertainment, but also as a manifesto of certain
philosophies and ideas, including suckless programming, extreme portability,
anti-copyright, selflessness and anarcho-pacifism.

The game is special by its properties, which include:

- Extremely small size, the game can fit into <MINSIZE>, including all assets.
- Very low hardware demands, being able to run on <MINFREQ> embedded CPUs.
- No library dependencies – The game is written in pure C without any I/O, which
  is left for each platform's frontend to implement.
- Implementation simplicity – no build system is needed, only a single file
  needs to be compiled. The whole source code has <LOCTOTAL> lines of code.
- All assets are part of the source code, so no filesystem is required for the
  game.
- Extreme portability thanks to the above. Official ports exist for PC, browser
  and embedded consoles like Pokitto and Gamebuino Meta.
- Made completely from scratch with only free software, including the engine and
  assets.
- Completely public domain status, being released under CC0.

The game is a "pseudo 3D" first person shooter, like Doom, and consists of 10
levels. The graphics uses a 256 color palette and is a little simpler than that
of Doom, having e.g. no textures on floor and ceiling and using just 32x32 pixel
images. The engine uses software rendering and 2D raycasting for rendering.
There are multiple enemy types, weapons and items to pick up. Music is
procedurally generated (utilizing so called bytebeat).

===== freegamedev forum ======

Hello,

I am releasing version 1.0 of my suckless game Anarch that I've been working
on on evenings for a few years now.

It's probably a little different from what you expect from a typical modern
game, it looks like from early 90s and will seem backwards and dumb at first,
but it's just trying to do things differently. It's not just a game but also a
manifesto of some ideas I hold.

It is extremely small, completely public domain, no-dependency, no-file,
portable suckless anarcho-pacifist from-scratch 90s-style Doom clone that runs
everywhere, made for the benefit of all living beings. For more see the page
at libregamewiki: <LIBREGAMEWIKILINK>.

Game-wise Anarch offers:

- oldschool "pseudo 3D" raycasting rendering in 256 colors
- 10 levels, both interior and exterior, 16 wall textures
- varying floor and ceiling heights, ability to jump
- 6 weapons using 3 types of ammo
- 7 types of enemies
- optional primitive save/load system
- optional mouse support
- hidden secrets
