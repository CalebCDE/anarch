Anarch: a Very Special Game

Anarch: super small public domain no-dependency from-scratch suckless Doom clone

I've made this super small public domain no-dependency from-scratch suckless
Doom clone.

Anarch: extremely small, completely public domain no-dependency portable
suckless anarcho-pacifist from-scratch 90s-style Doom clone that runs
everywhere, made for the benefit of all living beings.

Anarch is a completely public domain, free software 90s-style anarcho-pacifist
Doom clone game which can fit into <MINSIZE> (including all assets), has
extremely low hardware demands, running on platforms with <MINRAM> of RAM on
<MINFREQ> CPU (which doesn't even has to have a floating point unit), has no
dependencies (not even standard C library), is extremely portable, made in pure
C99 subset of C++ completely from scratch (including the engine, all assets, the
font, palette etc.) with only free software and released completely into the
public domain, allowing absolutely any use. It was not made for profit or mere
entertainment, it is an engineering art and philosofical manifesto. For more
info see the website at <WEBSITE> or the repository at <REPOURL>.

======== opengameart =========

These are the assets from my public domain Doom-like game Anarch (<WEBSITE>).
I have made them all completely myself, from scratch, including taking my own
photos, recording my own sounds etc. I release them all under CC0 1.O, public
domain, for any use whatsoever.

# Finally releasing my suckless game Anarch!

I have spent a few years on this game. It is very special, one of its kind, a
manifesto to ideas and philosophies I hold.

The game is extremely small, completely public domain (CC0) free software, has
no-dependencies, is extremely portable, suckless, made completely from-scratch
in the 90s-style of the original Doom. I made it for the benefit of all living
beings and am now sharing it with you. Enjoy and spread it around!

======= video trailer =======

This is a trailer for my public domain Doom-like game Anarch. The game is very
special, extremely small, suckless, with tiny hardware demands, running
basically on any platforms. It has many nice properties and is one of its kind.
It is completely free, both as in gratis and freedom. To get it, visit

The game uses software rendering using raycasting and a custom 256 color
palette.

======= libregamewiki ========

Anarch is a completely public domain, free software, 90s-style anarcho-pacifist
Doom-like libre game. It was created by drummyfish, made with a special
philosophy in mind.

The game is made for entertainment, but also as a manifesto of certain
philosophies and ideas, including suckless programming, extreme portability,
anti-copyright, selflessness and anarcho-pacifism.

The game is special by its properties, which include:

- Extremely small size, the game can fit into <MINSIZE>, including all assets.
- Very low hardware demands, being able to run on <MINFREQ> embedded CPUs.
- No library dependencies – The game is written in pure C without any I/O, which
  is left for each platform's frontend to implement.
- Implementation simplicity – no build system is needed, only a single file
  needs to be compiled. The whole source code has <LOCTOTAL> lines of code.
- Extreme portability thanks to the above. Official ports exist for PC, browser
  and embedded consoles like Pokitto and Gamebuino Meta.
- Made completely from scratch with only free software, including the engine and
  assets.
- Completely public domain status, being released under CC0.

The game is a "pseudo 3D" first person shooter, like Doom, and consists of 10
levels. The graphics uses a 256 color palette and is a little simpler than that
of Doom, having e.g. no textures on floor and ceiling and using just 32x32 pixel
images. The engine uses software rendering and 2D raycasting for rendering.
There are multiple enemy types, weapons and items to pick up. Music is
procedurally generated (utilizing so called bytebeat).
