## usage rights

**tl;dr: CC0 + waiver of all rights, completely public domain as much as humanly possible, do absolutely anything you want**

This work's goal is to never be encumbered by any exclusive intellectual property rights, it is intended to always stay completely and forever in the public domain, available for any use whatsoever.

I therefore release everything in this repository under CC0 1.0 (public domain, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) + a waiver of all other IP rights (including patents), which is as follows:

*Each contributor to this work agrees that they waive any exclusive rights, including but not limited to copyright, patents, trademark, trade dress, industrial design, plant varieties and trade secrets, to any and all ideas, concepts, processes, discoveries, improvements and inventions conceived, discovered, made, designed, researched or developed by the contributor either solely or jointly with others, which relate to this work or result from this work. Should any waiver of such right be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, the contributor hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to this right.*

Everything in this repository, including the code and assets, has been made completely by myself, Miloslav Ciz aka drummyfish, from scratch. I have **not** even reused any public domain material, as IP laws change and what has once been public domain may not be so in the future, so the only safe way for me to not infect this work with a potential disease I had to create it all myself.

Please support free software and free culture by using free licenses and/or waivers.
