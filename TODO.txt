- try to remove the debug flag (-g1) from compiler and see if it decreases size
- port to GB Meta
- GUI
- menu
- sounds (music?)
- level 2D map (with revealing, bitmap), special key for quick displaying map
- save/load (optional)
- enemies
- weapons
- more levels
- disable transparency for walls for performance (setting)?
- replace textures in distace with constant color for performance (setting)?
- add time slowdown constant
- if space left, try blurring (lerp) the level background, see how it looks
- create tables for monster and weapon stats in constants.h and read from that
  instead of cheking with ifs
- some monsters could reflect plasma, i.e. not be hurt by it, but reflect it
  back towards the player
- compile with different compilers (gcc, clang, musl, ...) and settings, make
  a build script that creates multiple binaries (with different combinations of
  compilers and settings)
- run on raspbery pi
- check if monsters are hit by bullets from completely up close

bugs:

done:

- add headbob
- make zBuffer 8bit only?
- texture coords of floor walls should start from the floor? NO, CAUSES ISSUES
- vertical visual noise when standing on elevator
- sprite positioning inccuracy
- try to compress images: store images as 4 bits per pixel + 16 color palette
  (subset of the 256 color palette), check if performance stays ok
- custom font
